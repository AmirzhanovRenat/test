You are a TA engineer, you have a repository with a `__specs__` subdirectory(integration tests), yesterday a couple of frontend developers decided to implement some cool features(popup ðŸ¤¯ ), along with this, making a few "unimportant" changes.

Your task is to fix failing test: `mock.spec.ts` and write your own tests: `addItemPopup.spec.ts` & `itemCount .spec.ts`
